# To-Do List Application

This is a basic To-Do List application built using Django. The application allows users to add, delete, create, and update tasks. Each user has their own set of tasks and can only view, modify, and delete their own tasks.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install Python and Django on your system
3. Create a virtual environment for the project
4. Activate the virtual environment
5. Install the required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the command `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database
7. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the server
8. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application

## Usage

To add a new task, click the "Add Task" button and enter the task details in the form. To edit an existing task, click the "Edit" button next to the task you want to modify and update the task details in the form. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.
