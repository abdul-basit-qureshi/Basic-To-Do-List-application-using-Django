# To-Do List Application

This is a basic To-Do List application built using Django. The application allows users to add, delete, create, search and update tasks. Each user has their own set of tasks and can only view, modify, and delete their own tasks.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install Python and Django on your system
3. Create a virtual environment for the project
4. Activate the virtual environment
5. Install the required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the command `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database
7. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the server
8. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application

## Usage

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the application using your username and password.
2. To add a new task, click the "+" icon and enter the task details in the form. You can include a description of the task and current stauts.
3. To edit an existing task, click the task name you want to modify and update the task details in the form. This is useful if you need to change the status and add more information to the task description.
4. To delete a task, click the "X" icon next to the task you want to remove. This is useful if you no longer need to do the task or if you accidentally added it.
5. To search for a task, enter keywords in the search bar and click the "Search" button. The application will display a list of tasks that match your search criteria.
6. To log out of the application, click the "Log out" button.
